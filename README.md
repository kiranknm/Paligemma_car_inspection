## Introduction

The Car Inspection Model is a fine tuned pali-gemma small vision language model fine-tuned to detect and describe car damage from images. It leverages the Pali-Gemma for transfer learning and fine-tuning.

## Dataset

The dataset used for fine-tuning consists of car images with corresponding damage descriptions hosted on huggingface. Each image is labeled with detailed annotations of the damage.
```
from datasets import dataset
ds = dataset("kiranmalape/car_inspection")
```
## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
